        Hybrid Homeschool Schedule

        Tuesday-Thursday 8:30-2:30

        Please note that the schedule is general, this allows for us to be responsive to student needs. Depending on
        enrollment in different grade level groups this can shift. Also, depending on how many middle school

        students we have, they may have a different schedule.

        8:00-8:30

        Drop off: Time for students to
        socialize, enjoy the morning beauty,
        and get their minds and bodies
        ready for the day.

        8:30-9:00
        One way we want to connect
        the ages of all students is to
        have them learn and talk
        about common Biblical
        messages. Starting with
        devotion, prayer time, and
        other activities that give us a
        deeper relationship with the
        Lord, will help us become a
        school family.
        “In your relationships with one
        another, have the same mindset
        as Christ Jesus.”
        Philippians 2:5
