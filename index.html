            Arc Learning Academy
            Hybrid Homeschool for Pre-K - 8

            Welcome to Arc Learning Academy! We appreciate the opportunity to share our heart and vision with you.
            Perhaps you have inquired about your child’s learning opportunities or you are just simply curious
            about Arc Learning Academy. Regardless, we are happy to share our hybrid homeschool with you!

            Arc Learning Academy was born from the desire for a different educational option for our own children; one
            in which our children get
            a unique learning experience that perpetuates growth for the whole child. While the public school system has
            been a part of each
            member of this team’s journey, we have all been led by the Lord to seek another opportunity for our own
            kids. As you may know, the
            2024-2025 school year will be our second year and, amazingly, in our first year we were blessed with 28
            students! The idea of
            growth is exciting to us this year, so we are grateful that you are trusting us with a new and innovative
            way to educate your children.
            A hybrid homeschool began as a novel concept, and has quickly become one of the most sought out options for
            families who are
            seeking an alternative to public school. The idea behind a hybrid homeschool is that it is a partnership
            between the teacher and the
            family. We appreciate the structure of traditional schooling, which provides consistency. Additionally, not
            every family can commit to
            a full-time homeschool experience for their children. A hybrid model allows for both. There will be days
            that your student learns in a
            group setting with his or her peers, as well as days that are optional and can be used for enrichment or
            remediation. Certified
            educators, who will be teaching from a Christian worldview, will be spending one on one and small group time
            with your child during
            school days. At Arc Learning Academy, your child will receive a customized education, one that is driven by
            observational and
            formative data, as well as your child’s strengths and weaknesses. The school days will be filled with
            learning through creative and
            advanced approaches and also building community with peers. Another aspect of Arc Learning Academy that is
            different from
            traditional schooling is the flexibility. Attendance and in-person instruction are vital, but there is no
            price tag on the nuclear family
            and the moments to be shared at home and with family. For that reason, we want to limit our days that are
            spent in the classroom so
            that those moments can be capitalized upon.

            My name is Amber Gilbert. The Jackson County area has always been home to me. I graduated from
            Commerce High School and have always felt a strong connection to our small town. From a very early age, I
            knew that I wanted to be a teacher one day. Some of my best memories are the days I converted a room in our
            basement to a classroom. I remember having a chalkboard and dry erase board and the smell of EXPO markers
            always tickled my fancy. All of those weekly packets of papers that I would bring home from school would end
            up
            in that classroom and would become my imaginary students’. I got my Middle Grades Education degree from the
            University of Georgia and began teaching 4th grade in Liberty County upon graduation. After teaching there
            for
            two years, I moved back home and taught at Maysville Elementary. Shortly after, I got married and because of
            my husband’s career and the time I spent traveling with him, I made the decision to resign, always believing
            I
            would go back to the classroom after having children. However, I knew when my son was born in 2017 that
            education would be
            different for us. Looking back, it is clear to me now that it was the Lord preparing my heart for what He
            would call me to in the
            summer of 2022.
            Shortly after embarking on this journey of finding another option for my children, I read the following
            verse during my morning quiet
            time: “Build a large boat from cypress wood...” Genesis 6:14. God had just instructed Noah to build an ark
            because He was about to
            destroy the earth with a flood. At the time that Noah began building, it was not even raining yet. No doubt,
            he was considered a fool
            by many. Yet, he was still obedient. Noah continued to follow God’s direction despite whatever feelings of
            inadequacy or fear he may
            have been experiencing. That spoke to me, in an incredibly loud way. Noah did not need all the pieces of the
            puzzle in order to be
            obedient. He trusted God. At the right time, he would know more information. He knew he would better
            understand the assignment
            according to God’s timing and that eventually he would actually see a drop of rain. The same has been true
            for this journey. It is
            difficult to plan something so monumental and influential blindly. Yet, that is what we have done because we
            have truly desired that
            God take the lead on this and have trusted that He would provide for our needs. So, when it came time for a
            name, Arc Learning
            Academy just fit. We know, the boat Noah built was an ark, not an arc. However, both words apply here. Our
            desire for this school is
            to provide a boat, or an ark. We want to give parents and students another way to educate their children as
            we all step out in faith to
            do what the Lord is calling us to. Additionally, we are agreeing to a promise. That promise is to educate
            your child in a new,
            innovative, creative, functional and fun way. The Lord gave a promise to His people too. He promised to
            never destroy the earth
            again by flood and He put a rainbow in the sky to signify that promise. The rainbow is an arc. Therefore,
            what we are pledging to is
            the boat, the place, the people as well as the promise to partner with you and assist you in the education
            of your most precious gift.

            Arc Learning Academy Vision, Mission, and Beliefs

            Vision Statement

            Our vision is for Arc Learning Academy to provide families with an alternative to traditional public school
            education. We desire to educate each student based on individual needs and interests with innovative and
            creative
            approaches, which are backed by research. Our structure will be flexible while still providing the routines
            and community
            that are found in traditional schooling. Students at Arc Learning Academy will be educated from a Christian
            worldview and
            will be given opportunities to explore the biblical connections to what is being taught in the classroom.
            Arc Learning
            Academy is meant to be the place where your child can become his or her own vessel, while learning to
            advocate for
            oneself and create a path into the future.

            Mission Statement

            The mission of Arc Learning Academy is to educate each child with an individualized plan and also to assist
            in
            developing the whole child. By “whole child” we mean, developing a child’s social skills, encouraging and
            guiding a
            closer walk with Jesus, incorporating and learning real-life and/or vocational skills on top of mastering
            the basic content
            areas of reading, writing, mathematics, science and social studies.
            Belief Statements

            At Arc Learning Academy, we believe in both the visual of a rainbow and also the promise associated
            with it. Our hope is that we will assist you in educating your child and, in time, we will all see evidence
            of growth, both in content areas and character, which will resemble an arc. It is our job to provide the
            vessel in which the growth is facilitated along with a promise to you in the form of a partnership as we
            work together to educate your child. “I have placed my rainbow in the clouds. It is a sign of my covenant
            with you and with all of the earth.” Genesis 9:13
            We believe that parental involvement in a child’s education is essential. “Train up a child in the way he
            should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it” Proverbs 22:6
            We believe in providing a Christ-centered curriculum based on biblical truth that will result in clear,
            critical thinking and a Christian world-view. “Work hard so you can present yourself to God and receive his
            approval. Be a good worker, one who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly explains the word of
            truth.” 2 Timothy 2:15
            We believe in inspiring students to discover their God-given potential, become life-long learners, and
            stand on God's absolute truth. “How much better to get wisdom than gold, and good judgment than silver.”
            Proverbs 16:16
            We believe God is the Creator and Sustainer of all life, which includes our unique hybrid
            homeschool. “So God created human beings in his own image.” Genesis 1:27
